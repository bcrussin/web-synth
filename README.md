# Web Synthesizer

The goal of this project is to provide a customizable synthesizer that supports mouse, keyboard, and MIDI control. Future plans include custom waveforms, LFOs, and key bindings.
Most web-based synths do not provide a high level of control (especially in regards to key bindings), so this project aims to provide as custom an experience as possible.
